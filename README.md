# Dynamic Pose Integration into Static 3D Gaussian Environments using Sparse Camera Setup
In this project we aim to recreate static scenes and add dynamic people into the scene using a single camera and recording the same action from multiple angles.

In the notebook you'll find out how to render the representations and how they are trained.

Here is a [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jCHJ-p2XZ9G_YfjK8zg2acvkTjOCiYOD?usp=sharing) to the datasets if you want to train your own model. They also include a trained model.

Here are also some videos of both the static and dynamic scenes that were created.
